# NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes New York City Yellow Taxi trip records to uncover travel patterns, revenue trends, and spatial demand using interactive data visualizations. The analysis was performed on large-scale transportation datasets and presented through a Power BI dashboard to support data-informed decision making.

The project focuses on end-to-end data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and dashboard development, translating raw trip data into actionable insights for operational and business understanding.
